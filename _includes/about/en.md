Nice to meet you!  

You can call me Ji Zhang, and this blog is to record my learning process and essays.  

As a student with nothing, I have a wonderful but sometimes burdensome college career. Thanks to my girlfriend and whose who make my life colorful.

What a shame that I idle away my past college years and it's time learn programming seriously again.  

Apologize for my poor English. Wish you a good day.
